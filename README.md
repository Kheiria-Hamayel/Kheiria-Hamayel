## Hi I'm Kheiria Hamayel 👋

### 👩‍💻 About Me

- 💼 I'm currently working as software developer in Nokia's team in Exalt company. Where we are using java, spring boot, docker and microservices to build Restful APIs. Also running my own business: **[@whateversnap24](https://www.instagram.com/whateversnap24)** – a handcrafted gift shop
- 🧠 I'm sharpening my skills in **problem-solving** and **design patterns**
- 💡 I had an internship at the same company as a backend developer. I built a web app using spring boot, MySql and docker.
- 🎓I graduated as a computer engineer minor accounting from Birzeit University.
- I'm excited to join a company where I can contribute as a full stack developer or software architect, taking on new challenges that will help me further develop my skills and make a positive impact for the company, much like what I'm currently doing in my current role.
